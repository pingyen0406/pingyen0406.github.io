Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Photonics, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, under the supervision of [You-Chia Chang](https://nycusng.web.nycu.edu.tw/pi/).  

My reasarch topics are related to silicon photonics and metasurfaces. For the past few years, I worked on monolithic integration between silicon photonics and metasurfaces. Recently, I am working on increasing the resolution of the silicon photonic beam steerer.
